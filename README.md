# Project: RSS feed aggregator

## Introduction
The project consists in the creation of the back-end of an RSS feed aggregator. The goal is to create an application able to gather in one place articles from different websites to which a user has subscribed.

To do this, we will use the RSS (Really Simple Syndication) format, a data format derived from XML, which allows websites to offer a summarized information flow, containing the latest published articles. Our application will therefore use Web Scrapers to retrieve articles from the various sites to which users have subscribed, store them in a database and expose them via an API.

In this case study, we will describe the architecture and technologies used to route the data and its storage, as well as the data model. We will also discuss the robustness and performance of the chosen architecture.
